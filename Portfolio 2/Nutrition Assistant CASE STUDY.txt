Project Name: Nutrition Assistant Application

Project Overview:
The Nutrition Assistant Application is a web-based tool designed to promote healthy eating habits by automatically estimating food attributes and nutritional values based on uploaded images of food. It employs Clarifai's AI-Driven Food Detection Model for food identification and integrates Nutrition API to provide nutritional information. The application targets individuals seeking to manage their calorie intake and improve their dietary choices. Additionally, it offers a platform for therapeutic nutrition prescriptions in clinical settings, facilitating personalized nutrition consultations.

Problem Statement:
The rise in obesity rates due to poor dietary habits is a growing health concern. While food packaging provides nutritional labels, people often find it inconvenient to refer to them regularly. This project addresses the need for a user-friendly app that can analyze real-time images of meals and provide nutritional content, thereby encouraging healthier eating habits.

Proposed Solution:
The Nutrition Assistant Application aims to:

Detect and recognize food items in real-time.
Evaluate the nutrient values of detected foods.
Cluster users based on their BMI for personalized recommendations.
Raise awareness about obesity and its health implications.
Offer a beneficial and economically viable business model.
Functional Requirements and Implementation Details:

User Registration: Users can register via email or phone number.
User Confirmation: Confirmation is sent through email and SMS.
User Profile Completion: Users provide personal details like height and weight.
Meal Image Upload: Users can upload photos of their meals.
Calorie Information Display: The app integrates Clarifai API for food recognition and Nutrition API to retrieve calorie information.
Conclusion:
The Nutrition Assistant Application empowers users to make informed dietary choices by recognizing food items and providing nutritional information. It encourages healthier eating habits and can be used without any specialized equipment. This technology also has potential applications beyond nutrition, such as in classrooms or presentations.

Key Takeaways:
Advantages:

Promotes healthier eating.
Easy progress tracking.
Raises nutritional awareness.
Keeps users motivated.
Comprehensive health tool.
